# CatchUp

## About

Catchup is supposed to be a platform for organisations to share updates, called posts,
and then these posts are viewed using the wasm SDK [WIP] or through integration into
other applications.

This is developed using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and uses [sqlite](https://www.sqlite.org/) in the backend.
