# Catchup

This is a personal project which is supposed to propel my knowledge in multi-threaded
applications.

Catchup is intended to by used by communities, organisations and any other entity
who engage others through updates over X(Twitter) or any other similar platform.
The only difference here is, these are supposed to act as a one way communication
from the organisation to community. This can be used by governments to provide
daily(or maybe more frequent) updates to the general public, or a sports tournament
organizer to update others of the latest events.

## Early development
